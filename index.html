            <p> Thanks for visiting my profile! My name is Francis but most call me Frankie, and I am 23-years-old and am born and raised in Southern NH.  
                I am a huge Boston sports fan and in my free time I enjoy cooking, fishing, and construction/building projects! 
            </p>
            <p> I graduated from Sanborn Regonial high school in 2018, and pursued a degree in engineering eventually switch to programing/
            </p>
            <p>
                I currently work in construction and have been since i graduted and loved challenging myself on the day to day basis..
                What comes along with construction to me is learning not only how to use math and be creative enough to picture your deisgn in your head and then building it. 
                Construction challenges you mentally and physically and puts your skills to the test everyday which i love.
            </p>

                In 2023 I began to pursue an interest in coding and web development and enrolled in UNHâ€™s immersive coding 
                bootcamp. I will be tackling coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as other basic 
                principles of web design and development. So far I am greatly enjoying the challenge that this class 
                provides and am looking forward to pushing myself and all that this course has to offer.
